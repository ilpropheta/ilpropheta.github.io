# TL;DR -- in a nutshell

For most of the day, my C++ has been serving the **Ferrari F1 Racing Team (Scuderia Ferrari)** since 2011.

Apart from private life, I love spending my spare time on some activities:

 - I have shaped [++it, the Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org/), or the C++ landmark in Italy. I moderate the online community, I organize events and meetups, etc;

 - I have been an **editor** of [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/) since 2014. I help moderate the International C++ online community;
 
 - I love experimenting and prototying – here is my [GitHub page](http://github.com/ilpropheta/);

 - I often [blog](http://marcoarena.wordpress.com) and [speak](#talks-workshops) about *stories* (not only tech) I think they are worth telling. I have given talks at many famous events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*, *Future Decoded* and *NoSlidesConf*;
 
 - In 2016 and 2017 Microsoft gave me the **MVP award** for [my community activies related to Visual C++](https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena);
 
 - In the last years, I’ve turned into a **Competitive Programming** aficionado. Here is my [HackerRank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/ilpropheta). To share this passion, I have created an monthly laboratory called [Coding Gym](#coding-gyms), consisting in collaborative coding dojos hosted at local user group meetings. I moderate a coding gym per month.

# Talks & Workshops

> Marco is a fantastic speaker. He is passionate. He captures his audience with a balanced mix of technical facts and sense of humour. His examples and stories make concepts clear, and he focuses on explaining the ideas before the details. He has all these features, and he puts them in every single sentence.

> Feedback by **Andrea Baruzzo** at **Meetup Pordenone 2015**

I love telling *stories*, I love interacting with people attending. My stories are not only about *technical* things but also about *personal development* and lessons I have learned.

I have given talks at many famous events, such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Future Decoded*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*. I'm also used to speaking at events organized by my own community, the *Italian C++ Community*.

For some of the talks that follow I got some feedback (generally from 1 to 5 <i class="icon-star"></i>). For the others, the event did not have a way to rate talks or the results are not public.

Some events I spoke at provided a joind.in page. You can check out my [Joind.in public profile](https://joind.in/user/ilpropheta) for a quick overview.

# Coding Gym

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.italiancpp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/WP_20170124_21_20_08_Pro.jpg" alt="Modena Coding Gym" width="650"/>
<br/>

In **2016** I created [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org), a programming lab format targeting anyone is keen on improving proficiency in designing and coding algorithms. I have developed such format for people to:

- improve problem analysis and solving skills
- improve fluency with the standard library and the idioms of known programming languages
- practice understanding and balancing programming compromises
- learn new algorithms, data structures and coding patterns
- practice unknown programming languages and paradigms

Coding Gym is **independent from the programming language** **and** **from the paradigm**. 

Coding Gym is hosted monthly in Modena.

The [Coding Gym website](http://coding-gym.org) includes more details, next and past events and pictures.

# Popular posts

In **2012**, I was the first Italian to publish an article on [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/), the official C++ Standard Foundation website. 

Since **2014** I have joined the staff of isocpp.org editors and I have started helping to moderate the international C++ online community.

My professional blogging activity started in **2011**.
