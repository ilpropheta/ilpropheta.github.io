# TL;DR -- in a nutshell

I am a 14+ years experienced Computer Engineer from Rome, specialized in **C++ software development**.

Since the end of **2019**, I have worked on bringing artificial intelligence to [Tetra Pak](http://tetrapak.com/) packaging machines. Previously, I developed mission-critical data analysis and simulation software for [Ferrari's F1 Team (Scuderia Ferrari)](https://formula1.ferrari.com/en/).

Beyond the code, I'm a **12+ years experienced community manager**, organizer, blogger, and speaker: I birthed the **Italian C++ Community** in 2013, **Coding Gym** in 2016 (a programming laboratory open to all languages), and **ML Modena** (Machine Learning Modena) in 2020 - the *AI* community in Modena. Together, these initiatives have welcomed thousands of attendees, hosting meetups, coding laboratories, online events, and international conferences. I've been a [Microsoft MVP]((https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena)) annually since 2016 for my contributions.

Through these activities, I’ve gained hands-on experience in building and managing business relationships, even among companies competing in the same industry, coordinating their collaboration toward shared goals. I’ve also worked on gathering support and resources to keep non-profit events thriving and successfully navigating agreements on sponsorships, venues, and event partnerships.

A few more details about my communities:

- in 2013, I founded [++it, the Italian C++ Community](https://italiancpp.org/), the C++ landmark in Italy, hosting ~400 users on Discord, 250+ attendees at on-site events. The community has hosted monthly local meetups in Modena (20-25 attendees) since 2017, in Milan (50-60 attendees) since 2024, and one international conference every year (before 2020, we used to organize two major conferences every year);

- in 2016, I founded [Coding Gym](#coding-gym), a programming lab open to all languages where people pair up and work on coding challenges. Originally launched in *Modena*, I now lead an incredible group of "trainers" who run the same format, even discontinuously, in their cities. At the moment, I personally host a session in Modena every 2 months. In the last decade, I've authored and published over 150 articles on the [Coding Gym challenges website](https://coding-gym.org/challenges/), exploring a variety of approaches and programming languages, enriched by insights and solutions shared by participants during mine and other sessions;

- in 2020 (before AI was cool 😝), I co-founded [ML Modena](https://mlmodena.it/), the first (and only one) community about *Artificial Intelligence* in the *Modena* area. I lead the staff to organize a meetup every 2-3 months, hosting 80-100 people (our best turnout so far is *150+* attendees at a regular meetup and *230* during a special networking event).

Also, I am involved in some other community activities:

- I have been an **editor** of [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/) since 2014. I help moderate the International C++ online community;

- since 2016, I have joined the staff of [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org), a non-profit organization making divulgation in the Modena area;

- since 2016, I have joined the staff of [Meeting C++](https://meetingcpp.com/), volounteering at the conference every year since then;

- in 2018, I co-founded [Community Crumbs](https://communitycrumbs.org/), a non-profit organization patronizing all my community activities. This adventure ended in 2020.

Sometimes, I [blog](http://marcoarena.wordpress.com) and [speak](#talks--workshops). I have given talks at many popular events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*, *DevFest*, *Future Decoded*, *NoSlidesConf*, *Italian Community Managers Summit*, local meetups and *Italian C++ Community* events. Also, I have authored and published [more than 150 articles on coding challenges using idiomatic C++ and sometimes other programming languages](https://coding-gym.org/challenges/).

Recognized for my efforts, I've received the **Microsoft MVP award** ten times since 2016, a testament to my impactful [community contributions](https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena).

At present, I am actively engaged in the following recurring activities:  

- Organizing *Italian C++ Community* meetups in Milan, monthly or bi-monthly;
- Hosting *Coding Gym* sessions in Modena, bi-monthly;
- Supporting the organization of *ML Modena* AI-themed meetups in Modena, bi-monthly;
- Serving as on-site staff at *Meeting C++*, every year;
- Occasionally helping organize tech events like *DevFest Modena* or special *ConoscereLinux* meetups;
- Bringing *Coding Gym* to tech conferences such as *DevFest* or *AgileDay* on occasion;
- Delivering talks at tech conferences or local meetups from time to time;
- Management of the social media of my communities and moderating their online channels such as Telegram and Discord.

# Talks & Workshops

> Marco is a fantastic speaker. He is passionate. He captures his audience with a balanced mix of technical facts and sense of humour. His examples and stories make concepts clear, and he focuses on explaining the ideas before the details. He has all these features, and he puts them in every single sentence.

> Feedback by **Andrea Baruzzo** at **Meetup Pordenone 2015**

I love sharing *stories* and *connecting* with people. My stories aren't just about technical topics-they also touch on personal development and the lessons I've learned along the way.

I've had the privilege of speaking at renowned events like *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*, *DevFest*, *Future Decoded*, *NoSlidesConf*, *Italian Community Managers Summit*, local meetups and *Italian C++ Community* events.

Some events I spoke at provided a *joind.in* page. You can check out my [Joind.in public profile](https://joind.in/user/ilpropheta) for a quick overview.

# Events & Meetups

I have extensive experience organizing events, including international conferences, meetups, and various community activities.

In addition to my primary focus on the [Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org/), [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org) and [ML Modena](https://mlmodena.it), I also actively support other user groups. For example, I'm a dedicated volunteer at [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org).

Every meetup and event I've organized has been completely free to attend and designed to foster an inclusive environment where people from all backgrounds feel welcome and valued. A core principle of my community philosophy is *embracing spontaneity over imposing*. My approach focuses on creating an environment where people feel at ease and included.

# Coding Gym

<img src="/pics/coding-gym.png" alt="Modena Coding Gym" width="650"/>
<br/>

In **2016** I created [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org), a monthly programming lab format developed to practice programming and soft-skills. If you want to know more about the story of Coding Gym, please check out [this page](https://coding-gym.org/story/).

When people ask me "what is Coding Gym?", I usually answer "at Coding Gym, we practice expressing ourselves through programming and collaboration".

People who has attended Coding Gym for some years tell that Coding Gym is a friendly environment to:

- practice and improve problem solving skills
- practice collaborating, speaking, exchanging ideas with other people
- practice understanding and balancing compromises in programming and software development
- learn new algorithms, data structures and coding patterns
- experiment with programming languages and paradigms they are not fluent with

In 2016, I started up Coding Gym in Modena, and since 2018 I have developed a format that has been adopted by other "trainers" to bring Coding Gym in new places. For coordinating this, I have been leading the community of "trainers" of Coding Gym that operates behind the scenes. Currently, Coding Gym is active in Modena, Padua, Milan, Turin, Bari, Lecce, Bassano del Grappa, and Rome.

[The official website](https://coding-gym.org) contains more details, next and past events, and pictures.

# Machine Learning Modena (ML Modena)

<img src="/pics/mlmodena20.png" alt="ML Modena First Event" width="650"/>
<br/>

In **2020** I co-founded [ML Modena](https://mlmodena.it), the first open community about Artificial Intelligence in the Modena area. The community is part of the network of [IAML](https://iaml.it/), the Italian Association for Machine Learning.

The very first event planned for February 2020 was canceled due to COVID-19 emergency and re-organized in December as [online-only event](#machine-learning-modena-kick-off-event).

## C++ in Competitive Programming

In **2016**, I started the blog series *C++ in Competitive Programming*, about algorithms, idioms and usage of C++ for solving programming challenges. Every post in the series have been published on [isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org/) too.

Current installments:

## SObjectizer Tales

In **2023**, I started the blog series [SObjectizer Tales](https://marcoarena.wordpress.com/sobjectizer-tales/), about concurrent C++, made simple. In this series, I progressively develop a program to acquire and process webcam images while exploring the many features of SObjectizer, a library that simplifies concurrent application development using message passing and the actor model. Every post in the series have been published on [isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org/) too. The series is also available on [dev.to](https://dev.to/ilpropheta/series/24883).

Check out all the published installments [here](https://marcoarena.wordpress.com/sobjectizer-tales/).

# Timeline

Here's a quick look at some key moments that (I think) have shaped my professional journey — mostly "firsts" that stand out. This is as much a reminder for myself as it is a snapshot of my path. I'm not the type to say, "I started programming at 8" or such, as if that's the only way to become a good developer. I didn’t spend my childhood glued to a screen, coding all night, avoiding sports, and obsessing over computers and videogames. Instead, I had a balanced and cheerful childhood, thanks to my family. I played sports, had fun, and just enjoyed being a kid. I was introduced to computers early on, and while I was instantly fascinated, I let that seed of passion grow, watering it from time to time without drowning or straining it. When the time was right, I was ready to dive in and take the next big step.
