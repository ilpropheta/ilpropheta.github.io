# TL;DR -- in a nutshell

I am a 12+ years experienced Computer Engineer from Rome, specialized in **C++ software development**.

Since the end of **2019**, I have worked at [Tetra Pak](http://tetrapak.com/) as one of the technical leaders of the *AI Engineering Team*, pioneering the development of AI-based applications for packaging lines. Previously, **from 2011 to 2019**, I served the [Ferrari F1 Racing Team (Scuderia Ferrari)](https://formula1.ferrari.com/en/) as a *Performance Software Engineer* and *C++ Specialist*, working on mission-critical telemetry and simulation software, and driving the adoption of modern C++ and latest standards. In **2020**, I have co-founded the **ISO C++ Italian body**, becoming part of the Standard C++ delegation for Italy.

In my spare time, I am also a 10+ years experienced community manager, organizer, blogger, and speaker: I gave birth to *Italian C++ Community* (2013), *Coding Gym* (2016), and *ML Modena* (2020). I have organized more than 150 activities - including meetups, coding laboratories, online events, and international conferences - attended by ~5000 people overall.

In particular:

- in 2013, I founded [++it, the Italian C++ Community](https://italiancpp.org/), or the C++ landmark in Italy, hosting 200+ users on Discord, 300+ subscribers on a dedicated [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/cppit), 200+ attendees at on-site events, and sending a monthly newsletter targeting 1500+ people. The community hosts monthly local meetups in Modena (hosting 20-25 people), and also two international conferences every year;

- in 2016, I created [Coding Gym](#coding-gym), a programming laboratory format open to any language. Started by me in Modena, I am also leading a group of amazing "trainers" who host the very same format in their cities. Every month, I organize a moderated and inclusive session hosting 25-30 people who work in pair and collaboratively share their solutions and ideas. Besides, I have authored and published more than 120 articles on [Coding Gym challenges](https://coding-gym.org/challenges/) using different approaches and programming languages;

- in 2020, I co-founded [ML Modena](https://mlmodena.it/), the first (and unique) community about Artificial Intelligence in the Modena area. Every month we organize a meetup hosting 60-70 people.

Also, I am involved in some other community activities:

- I have been an **editor** of [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/) since 2014. I help moderate the International C++ online community;

- since 2016, I have joined the staff of [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org), a non-profit organization making divulgation in the Modena area;

- since 2016, I have joined the staff of [Meeting C++](https://meetingcpp.com/), volounteering at the conference every year since then;

- in 2018, I co-founded [Community Crumbs](https://communitycrumbs.org/), a non-profit organization patronizing all my community activities. This adventure ended in 2020.

Sometimes, I [blog](http://marcoarena.wordpress.com) and [speak](#talks--workshops). I have given talks at many popular events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*, *Future Decoded*, *NoSlidesConf*, *Italian Community Managers Summit*, local meetups and *Italian C++ Community* events (however, I tend to avoid going onstage at my own community's conferences to let other people share their stories). Also, I have authored and published [more than 120 articles on coding challenges](https://coding-gym.org/challenges/).

Since 2016, I have received (8 times in a row) the **Microsoft MVP award** for [my community activies](https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena).

# Talks & Workshops

> Marco is a fantastic speaker. He is passionate. He captures his audience with a balanced mix of technical facts and sense of humour. His examples and stories make concepts clear, and he focuses on explaining the ideas before the details. He has all these features, and he puts them in every single sentence.

> Feedback by **Andrea Baruzzo** at **Meetup Pordenone 2015**

I love telling *stories* and interacting with people. My stories are not only about *technical* things but also about *personal development* and lessons I have learned.

I have given talks at many popular events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Future Decoded*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*. I'm also used to speaking at events organized by my own community, the *Italian C++ Community*.

For some of the talks that are listed in this page I got some feedback (generally from 1 to 5 <i class="icon-star"></i>). For the others, the event did not have a way to rate talks or the results are not publicly available.

Some events I spoke at provided a joind.in page. You can check out my [Joind.in public profile](https://joind.in/user/ilpropheta) for a quick overview.

I proudly developed and recorded the *C++ online course* of the *Enciclopedia Treccani*, the most popular encyclopedia in the Italian language.

I designed the course from scratch, deciding the slant and contents. The course is organized in 4 modules and it lasts for 4 hours. <br/>

# Events & Meetups

I'm used to organizing events, meetups and other activities. <br/>
In addition to my community activities ([Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org/), [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org) and [ML Modena](https://mlmodena.it)), I'm happy to help other user groups. For example, I am a regular "worker" of [ConoscereLinux](http://conoscerelinux.org).

# Coding Gym

<img src="/pics/coding-gym.png" alt="Modena Coding Gym" width="650"/>
<br/>

In **2016** I created [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org), a monthly programming lab format developed to practice programming and soft-skills. If you want to know more about the story of Coding Gym, please check out [this page](https://coding-gym.org/story/).

When people ask me "what is Coding Gym?", I usually answer "at Coding Gym, we practice expressing ourselves through programming and collaboration".

People who has attended Coding Gym for some years tell that Coding Gym is a friendly environment to:

- practice and improve problem solving skills
- practice collaborating, speaking, exchanging ideas with other people
- practice understanding and balancing compromises in programming and software development
- learn new algorithms, data structures and coding patterns
- experiment with programming languages and paradigms they are not fluent with

In 2016, I started up Coding Gym in Modena, and since 2018 I have developed a format that has been adopted by other "trainers" to bring Coding Gym in new places. For coordinating this, I have been leading the community of "trainers" of Coding Gym that operates behind the scenes. Currently, Coding Gym is active in Modena, Padua, Milan, Turin, Bari, Lecce, Bassano del Grappa, and Rome.

[The official website](https://coding-gym.org) contains more details, next and past events, and pictures.

# Machine Learning Modena (ML Modena)

<img src="/pics/mlmodena20.png" alt="ML Modena First Event" width="650"/>
<br/>

In **2020** I co-founded [ML Modena](https://mlmodena.it), the first open community about Artificial Intelligence in the Modena area. The community is part of the network of [IAML](https://iaml.it/), the Italian Association for Machine Learning.

The very first event planned for February 2020 was canceled due to COVID-19 emergency and re-organized in December as [online-only event](#machine-learning-modena-kick-off-event).

# Popular posts

# Timeline

Here is a list of *some* notable events/milestones possibly influencing my professional life, most of which are in the form "first time I did *something*". This is especially a reminder for myself. I am not that kind of person who snobbishly writes "I have started programming at 8" or such, corroborating the idea that good programmers are only those geeks who spent their childhood nights at writing code, obsessed with computers, and bad at sports. Thanks to my family, I had a happy childhood, I practiced several sports, and had a genuine cheerful time. I was exposed to computers when I was a child and I immediatly got intrigued, but then I let that seed of passion grow by watering it from time to time without straining. When the time came, I was ready to push and to make a step forward.
