# TL;DR -- in a nutshell

I am a Computer Engineer from Rome, specialized in high performance and critical software development in C++. For most of the day, my C++ has been serving the **Ferrari F1 Racing Team (Scuderia Ferrari)** since 2011. Behind the scenes, I define myself a "Community Hacker" because I'm very active in the tech communities ecosystem in Italy and abroad.

Apart from private life, I love spending my spare time on several activities gathered here below:

- in 2013, I founded [++it, the Italian C++ Community](https://italiancpp.org/), or the C++ landmark in Italy. I moderate the online community, I organize events and meetups, etc;

- in 2016, I created [Coding Gym](#coding-gym), a monthly programming laboratory format and community currently active in Modena, Pauda, Milan, Rome, Turin and Bari;

- I have been an **editor** of [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/) since 2014. I help moderate the International C++ online community;

- I have joined [ConoscereLinux](https://conoscerelinux.org) staff since 2016;

- in 2018, I have co-founded [Community Crumbs](https://communitycrumbs.org/) a non-profit organization patronizing all my community activities;

- I often [blog](http://marcoarena.wordpress.com) and [speak](#talks--workshops) about *stories* (not only tech) I think they are worth telling. I have given talks at many famous events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*, *Future Decoded*, *NoSlidesConf*, local meetups and, clearly, at *Italian C++ Community* events;
 
- I love experimenting and prototying – here is my [GitHub page](http://github.com/ilpropheta/);
 
- Since 2016 I have received (4 times in a row) the **Microsoft MVP award** for [my community activies](https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena).

# Talks & Workshops

> Marco is a fantastic speaker. He is passionate. He captures his audience with a balanced mix of technical facts and sense of humour. His examples and stories make concepts clear, and he focuses on explaining the ideas before the details. He has all these features, and he puts them in every single sentence.

> Feedback by **Andrea Baruzzo** at **Meetup Pordenone 2015**

I love telling *stories*, I love interacting with people attending. My stories are not only about *technical* things but also about *personal development* and lessons I have learned.

I have given talks at many famous events, such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Future Decoded*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*. I'm also used to speaking at events organized by my own community, the *Italian C++ Community*.

For some of the talks that follow I got some feedback (generally from 1 to 5 <i class="icon-star"></i>). For the others, the event did not have a way to rate talks or the results are not public.

Some events I spoke at provided a joind.in page. You can check out my [Joind.in public profile](https://joind.in/user/ilpropheta) for a quick overview.

# Events & Meetups

I'm used to organizing events, meetups and other activities. <br/>
First of all as the leader of the [Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org/) and [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org), in addition, I'm involved in supporting and helping a few other user groups. I am a "worker" of [ConoscereLinux](http://conoscerelinux.org) and I am part of the leading staff of [Modena Tech Scene](http://modenatechscene.it).

# Coding Gym

<img src="/pics/coding-gym.png" alt="Modena Coding Gym" width="650"/>
<br/>

In **2016** I created [Coding Gym](http://coding-gym.org), a monthly programming lab format developed to practice programming and soft-skills.

When people ask me "what is Coding Gym?", I'm used to answer "at Coding Gym, we practice expressing ourselves through programming and collaboration".

People who has attended Coding Gym for some years tell that Coding Gym is a friendly environment to:

- practice and improve problem solving skills
- practice collaborating, speaking, exchanging ideas with other people
- practice understanding and balancing compromises in programming and software development
- learn new algorithms, data structures and coding patterns
- experiment with programming languages and paradigms they are not fluent with

In 2016, I started Coding Gym in Modena and since 2018 I have been working to bring it in other cities by founding and leading a community of "trainers". Currently, Coding Gym is active in Modena, Rome, Milan, Turn, Padua, Bari and Barcelona.

[The official website](https://coding-gym.org) contains more details, next and past events, and pictures.

# Popular posts

In **2012**, I was the first Italian to publish an article on [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/), the official C++ Standard Foundation website. 

Since **2014** I have joined the staff of isocpp.org editors and I have started helping to moderate the international C++ online community.

My professional blogging activity started in **2011**.
