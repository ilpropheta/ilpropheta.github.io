## TL;DR -- in a nutshell

For most of the day, my C++ has been serving an **Italian Formula 1 Racing Team** since 2011.

Apart from private life, I love spending time (and nights) on other activities I’m gathering here:

 - I have shaped [++it, the Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org/), or the C++ landmark in Italy. I moderate the online community, I organize events and meetups, etc.

 - I have been an **editor** of [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/) since 2014. I help moderate the International C++ online community.
 
 - I love experimenting and prototying – here is my [GitHub page](http://github.com/ilpropheta/).

 - I often [blog](http://marcoarena.wordpress.com) and [speak](#talks-workshops) about *stories* (not only tech) I think they are worth telling. I have given talks at many famous events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay* and *Future Decoded*.
 
 - In 2016 Microsoft gave me the **MVP award** for [my activies related to Visual C++](https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena).
 
 - In the last years, I’ve turned into a **Competitive Programming** aficionado. Here is my [HackerRank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/ilpropheta). To share this passion, I  moderate collaborative [coding dojos](#coding-dojos) at local user group meetings.

Talks & Workshops
-------------

> Marco is a fantastic speaker. He is passionate. He captures his audience with a balanced mix of technical facts and sense of humour. His examples and stories make concepts clear, and he focuses on explaining the ideas before the details. He has all these features, and he puts them in every single sentence.

> Feedback by **Andrea Baruzzo** at **Meetup Pordenone 2015**

I love telling *stories* which I spice up with **humor**, **interacting** with people attending. My stories are not only about *technical* things but also about *personal development* and lessons I have learned.

I have given talks at many famous events, such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Future Decoded*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*. I have also spoken at events made by my own community, the *Italian C++ Community*.

Whenever possible, I link the public **feedback and rating** (generally from 1 to 5 <i class="icon-star"></i>) I have got for the corresponding talk. 

For an overview of the public feedback I have got check out my [Joind.in public profile](https://joind.in/user/ilpropheta).

Since **2016** I have started organizing monthly **Coding Dojos** hosted by local user groups (e.g. [XPUG Bologna](http://www.eventbrite.it/e/biglietti-incontro-di-febbraio-xpug-bologna-21448465939) and [LUG Modena "Conoscere Linux"](http://conoscerelinux.org/category/coding/)). 

Attendees work in pair to solve three programming challenges I propose at the meeting. After 30' I moderate a 10-15' retrospective and at the end of the event I summarize the lessons learned.

[Here is the list](http://www.italiancpp.org/coding-dojos/) of the previous and next coding dojos I have organized.
