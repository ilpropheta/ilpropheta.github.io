## TL;DR -- in a nutshell

For most of the day, my C++ has been serving an **Italian Formula 1 Racing Team** since 2011.

Apart from private life, I love spending time (and some nights) on other activities I’m trying to collect here. Summing them up:

 - I have shaped [++it, the Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org/), or the C++ landmark in Italy. I moderate the online community, I organize events, meetups, etc.

 - I have been an **editor** of [isocpp.org](http://isocpp.org/) since 2014. I help moderate the International C++ online community.
 
 - I love experimenting and prototying – here is my [GitHub page](http://github.com/ilpropheta/).

 - I often [blog](http://marcoarena.wordpress.com) and [speak](#talks-workshops) about *stories* (not only tech) I think they are worth telling. I have given talks at many famous events such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*.
 
 - In 2016 Microsoft gave me the **MVP award** for [my activies related to Visual C++](https://mvp.microsoft.com/it-it/PublicProfile/5001726?fullName=Marco%20%20Arena).
 
 - In the last 2 years, I’ve turned into a **Competitive Programming** aficionado. Here is my [HackerRank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/ilpropheta). Related: I also moderate collaborative programming puzzles evening and workshops.

Talks & Workshops
-------------

> Marco is a fantastic speaker. He is passionate. He captures his audience with a balanced mix of technical facts and sense of humour. His examples and stories make concepts clear, and he focuses on explaining the ideas before the details. He has all these features, and he puts them in every single sentence.

> Feedback by **Andrea Baruzzo** at **Meetup Pordenone 2015**

I love telling *stories*. I spice up my stories with some **humor** and I try to **interact** a lot with my attendees. My stories are not only about *technical* things but also about *personal development* and lessons I learned.

I have given talks at many famous events, such as *Microsoft Community Days*, *Italian Agile Day*, *Codemotion*, *QtDay*.

Whenever possible **feedback and rating** (generally from 1 to 5 <i class="icon-star"></i>) I got for the corresponding talk are linked. 

For an overview of the feedback I got check out my [Joind.in public profile](https://joind.in/user/ilpropheta).
