I am a Computer Engineer working in the F1 World. I define myself a pragmatic C++ enthusiast and I have shaped [++it - the Italian C++ Community](http://italiancpp.org). 
I'm an isocpp.org editor and I help moderating the international C++ online community.
I love telling stories and I often blog and speak about my technical and professional anecdotes of growth. My vision on software development resembles a quote by Bruce Lee: 
"The best programmer is someone who can adapt on any style". For this reason I like experimenting with new languages and technologies, even if my heart belongs to C++!
